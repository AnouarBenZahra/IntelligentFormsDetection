Doing image processing and especially blob analysis it is often required to check some objects' shape and depending on it perform further processing of a particular object or not. For example, some applications may require finding only circles from all the detected objects, or quadrilaterals, rectangles, etc. The article will describe some basic techniques, which may allow detecting such shapes like circles, triangles and quadrilaterals (plus their subtypes, like rectangle, rhombus, rectangled triangle, etc.). Note: most of the code snippets provided in the article are based on the AForge.NET framework, but can be easily implemented using any other library providing similar image processing routines.
